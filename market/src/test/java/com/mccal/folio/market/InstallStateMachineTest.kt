/**
 * The one rule the installer has to keep, whatever order things happen in: **the list and the Home screen agree.**
 *
 * A package the list calls installed and enabled has its changes on; one that is off, or gone, does not. Every way
 * in and out - install, update, undo, Safe Mode off, Try Again, remove - has its own path through that, and they
 * have been wrong in three different ways: turning a package off used to leave its changes applied, updating one
 * that was off undid changes that were already off, and undo put an off package's changes back on.
 *
 * So rather than one test per path, this walks the paths in every order it can and checks the rule after each step.
