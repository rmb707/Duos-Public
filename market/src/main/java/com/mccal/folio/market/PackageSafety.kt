 * What a package may and may not do, worked out from its manifest alone — never from anything its author wrote.

 * The "does not" list is the point: a Folio package is data, so the things people worry about (reading your messages,
 * phoning home, touching other apps) aren't things it's trusted not to do, they're things it has no way to do. The
 * format's rules are in docs/sdk/format-v1.md; ADR 0004 is why.
