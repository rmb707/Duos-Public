/**
 * Installing an app from the Market, the way Sileo does it: the store downloads, checks, and hands it over,
 * rather than sending you to somebody else's app and hoping you come back.
 *
 * **Off by default, and any source the user added may offer an app** (McCal, 2026-09-20). That is Cydia's and
 * Sileo's bargain, said plainly: you chose the source, so you chose what it may hand you.
 *
 * Four things still hold, and the setting's own words say so:
 *
 * - The index that named the app is **signed** by the source, and its key was pinned when it was added, so the
 *   listing is really that source's.
 * - The bytes must match the **checksum** the index promised, checked before the file is written anywhere
 *   Android can reach, so nothing can be swapped in on the way.
 * - **Android asks, every time.** Folio isn't the installer of record for other people's apps, so the system's
 *   own install screen appears with the app's real name on it.
 * - It is **off until someone turns it on**.
 *
 * What is not protected, and cannot be: Folio can't tell whether the app itself is any good. Software Update
 * can insist an update is signed with the same key as the copy already running; there is no such anchor for
 * somebody else's app. The source vouches for it, and that is the whole of it.
