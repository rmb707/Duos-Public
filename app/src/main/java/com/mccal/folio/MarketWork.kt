/**
 * An install that's already started, kept outside the screen that started it.
 *
 * Downloading and applying a package can't be stopped halfway - the work is a single block of file and network calls,
 * and cancelling a coroutine doesn't interrupt those. So when someone pressed Back while a package was downloading,
 * the package still landed on their Home screen, and the screen that would have said so was gone: no message, no
 * Undo, and no way to put it back.
 *
 * Keeping the work here means the Market can leave and come back. It holds what's in progress and the result nobody
 * has read yet, so reopening the store shows "… is on · Undo" exactly as if it had never been closed.
