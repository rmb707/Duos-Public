/**
 * Folio installing an app itself: when it may, and what it refuses to hand to Android.
 *
 * McCal's call (2026-09-20) is that any source the user added may offer an app, the way Cydia and Sileo work.
 * So the checks that remain are the ones that carry the weight: the setting, and the checksum.
